This repository works towards question #18 on the webpage https://www.notion.so/Analytics-Bounties-for-Alchemix-ffd6c25bdef3486c9b8dfa9476ac6a39. This question revolves around analyzing the activity of early and late adopters of the Alchemix (ALCX) cryptocurrency with how much ALCX makes up their portfolio, and how much value they stake in pools. We use Flipside Crypto data to conduct our study. 

Our solution is located in a jupyter notebook. The notebook can also use real-time data to update the attached graphs, and uses the util.py file to format data and perform computation.

I have included multiple ways to view the report:

Early_v_Late.ipynb --> This is a jupyter notebook. The code can be actually run in here by execting "jupyter notebook Early_v_Late.ipynb" in terminal from this directory.

Early_v_Late.pdf --> This is an exported PDF document of the write-up and code included in the jupyter notebook. This also includes the graphs that the code generates.
